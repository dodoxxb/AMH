
1. read requirements.txt and make sure you have installed all the packages

2. change the path in audio_config.py to your own data path

3. run audio_data_preprocess.py to preprocess wav files (now only denoise, but other steps could also be included if you want)

4. run audio_main.py to do unimodal classification.

Good luck.

warning:
ugly code
